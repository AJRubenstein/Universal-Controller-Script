A script aimed at adding compatibility for any MIDI controller and any plugin in
FL Studio.

# Setup

Refer to the [documentation](docs/setup.md).

# Documentation

Documentation is available [here](docs/README.md), and contains information for
users, as well as contributors.

If you have any ideas for the development of the script, or want to contribute, 
please [join the Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6vpfJUF). I'm excited
