# Universal-Controller-Script
A script aimed at adding compatibility for any MIDI controller in FL Studio

# WARNING: This script is currently not functional

This is a complete rewrite from the ground up of a concept script I made for the same purpose. Eventually, it should greatly surpass all of my previous work for the legacy version, but it is currently non-functional. If you wish to look at the original, please head to [MiguelGuthridge/Legacy-Universal-Controller-Script](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/Legacy-Universal-Controller-Script).

If you have any ideas for the development of the script, or want to contribute, please join the Discord Server [here](https://discord.gg/6vpfJUF). I'm excited to see where this project will go in the future: I have huge plans for it!
