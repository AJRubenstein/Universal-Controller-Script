# Universal-Controller-Script
A script aimed at adding compatibility for any MIDI controller and any plugin in
FL Studio.

# Setup

Refer to the [documentation](docs/setup.md).

If you have any ideas for the development of the script, or want to contribute, 
please join the Discord Server [here](https://discord.gg/6vpfJUF). I'm excited 
to see where this project will go in the future: I have huge plans for it!
