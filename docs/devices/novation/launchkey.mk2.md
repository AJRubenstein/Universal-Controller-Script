## Setup

1. Open FL Studio's MIDI Settings, and set a port for the controller listed as
   `MIDIIN2 (Novation Launchkey Mk2)` in both the input and output sections.
   Assign this device to the controller type "Universal Event Forwarded (user)",
   so that events from this script can be forwarded to the main script to be
   processed.

## Device Details

* If configured correctly, the device's InControl lights should turn on.
* The clip launch buttons are mapped to be a metronome button and a control
  switch button respectively.
